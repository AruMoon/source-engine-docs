## Source Engine

All game launchers of this engine port require main Source Engine app installed on your mobile device for running. So, firstly, you should install it.

[!file source-engine-v1.11.apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13TLJoZ4aoNeUAAsQRI_9NN5zCwzdXsNJ/view?usp=sharingchangelog)

!!!

After successful download, check the filename, your browser probably could rename `source-engine.apk` to `source-engine.apk.zip` which will turn into a zip archive file, you should rename it back to `source-engine.apk` to make it as android app package.

!!!

!!!

On Source Engine updates, you should always install them for applying the latest changes. Game launchers are rarely updated and only in case of game source code changes

!!!

### Important game resources

1. Buy the supported game from the guides below and download it on PC.
2. Create `srceng` folder in the home of internal storage `/storage/emulated/0/srceng` on mobile device.
3. Copy `platform` and `hl2` folders from the PC game to the `/storage/emulated/0/srceng` folder on mobile device.

You can also create `srceng` folder on the SD-card storage. But please note that SD-cards are not supported on Android 11+ due to Android policy.
